# About data ingestion
{: #load_ingest_data}

Data ingestion is the process of importing and loading data into {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_full}}. From the user interface (UI) of {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}}, you can use the **Ingest data** module from the **Data manager** page to securely and easily load data. Alternatively, you can also ingest local or remote data files to create tables by using the **Create table from file** option.
{: shortdesc}

When you ingest a data file into the {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}}, the table schema is generated and inferred when a query is run. The files to be ingested must be of the same format type and same schema. {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} auto-discovers the schema based on the source file being ingested.

Following are some of the requirements or behavior of data ingestion:

* Schema evolution is not supported.
* The target table must be an iceberg format table.
* IBM Storage Ceph, IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS), AWS S3, and MinIO object storage are supported.
* `pathStyleAccess` property for object storage is not supported.
* Parquet, CSV, JSON, ORC, and AVRO file formats are supported as source data files.
* The maximum limit for the cumulative size of files must be within 500 MB for local ingestion.
* Parquet, JSON, AVRO, and ORC files exceeding 2 MB cannot be previewed, but they will still be ingested successfully.
* JSON files with complex nested objects and arrays shall not be previewed in the UI.
* Complex JSON files shall be ingested as-is, resulting in arrays as table entries. This is not recommended for optimal data visualization and analysis.
* Keys within JSON files must be enclosed in quotation marks for proper parsing and interpretation.

## Loading or ingesting data through CLI
{: #load_ingest_datacli}

An ingestion job in {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} can be run with the **ibm-lh** tool. The tool must be pulled from the `ibm-lh-client` and installed in the local system to run the ingestion job through the CLI. For more details and instructions to install `ibm-lh-client` package and use the **ibm-lh** tool for ingestion, see [Installing ibm-lh-client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonxdata/1.1.x?topic=package-installing-lh-client){: external} and [Setting up the ibm-lh command-line utility](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonxdata/1.1.x?topic=utilities-setting-up-lh-cli-utility){: external}.

The **ibm-lh** tool supports the following features:

- Auto-discovery of schema based on the source file or target table.
- Advanced table configuration options for the CSV files:

   * Delimiter
   * Header
   * File encoding
   * Line delimiter
   * Escape characters

- Ingestion of a single, multiple files, or a single folder (no sub folders) of S3 and local Parquet files.
- Ingestion of a single, multiple files, or a single folder (no sub folders) of S3 and local CSV files.
