# Integrating with IBM Knowledge Catalog (IKC)
{: #ikc_integration}

Integrating {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_full}} with IBM Knowledge Catalog (IKC) provides self-service access to data assets (tables and views) for knowledge workers who need to use the data assets to gain insights.

IBM Knowledge Catalog - {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} integration supports the following connectors for governance:
* Hive
* Iceberg
* Hudi
* Delta Lake
* Oracle
* Postgresql
* Mysql
* SQL server
* Db2


## Before you begin
{: #prereq_ikc}

To enable IKC integration, ensure the following pre-requisites are met:

- A working {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} environment.
- A working IBM Knowledge Catalog (IKC) environment.
- IBM Knowledge Catalog and {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} are configured with [service-to-service authorization](watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-s2s_auth) in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Both {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} and IKC must be present in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment.
