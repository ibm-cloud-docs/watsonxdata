# Logging for {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}}
{: #log_analysis}

After you provision IBM Log Analysis to add log management capabilities to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} architecture, you can enable platform logs to view and analyze {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_full}} logs.
{: shortdesc}

## Platform logs
{: #platform_logs}

The IBM Log Analysis service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is now deprecated but will continue to be supported until the end of March, 2025, at which point all instances will be removed.  It is suggested that you migrate to IBM Cloud Logs/IBM Cloud Logs Routing as soon as possible to avoid disruptions.
{: note}

Platform logs are exposed by logging-enabled services and the platform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. If you have an existing Log Analysis instance in the same region as your {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_full}}, you can enable that instance for platform logs to view the logs for your {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_full}} instance.

For more information, see [Configuring IBM Cloud platform logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs).

The Log Analysis service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is now deprecated. The following are the replacement services which are used together to access and analyze Platform logs:
- [IBM Cloud Logs Routing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-getting-started): A routing service that allows customers to route platform logs generated by their provisioned services to one or more [targets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-tenant-create&interface=ui#tenant-create-ui), including instances of IBM Cloud Logs.
- [IBM Cloud Logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-logs): Use to store, index, visualize and alert on logging data.

For more information see the [IBM Cloud Logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-logs) documentation.


## Viewing Platform Logs using IBM Cloud Logs and IBM Cloud Logs Routing
{: #viewing_logs}

{{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} instances generate platform logs in the same region where they are available. You can view, monitor, and manage logs through an IBM Cloud Logs instance that is configured as an IBM Cloud Logs Routing target. See the [Monitoring platform logs in IBM Cloud Logs documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-cl-platform-logs&interface=ui) for details related to setting up IBM Cloud Logs Routing for platform logs, and [Provisioning an instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-instance-provision&interface=ui) for details related to provisioning and managing an IBM Cloud Logs instance.

## Viewing Platform Logs using IBM log Analysis
{: #viewing_logs2}

{{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} instances generate platform logs in the same region where they are available. You can view, monitor, and manage logs through the IBM Log Analysis instance that is marked as platform logs in the region.

To launch the Log Analysis web UI to view these logs, see [Navigating to the web UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-launch).

For more information about the locations where watsonx.data logs are available, see [Service locations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-cloud_services_locations).
