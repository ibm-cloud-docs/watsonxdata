**For New Users**

1. Enable Cloud Resource Name (CRN) access.
   Contact your IBM Cloud account team to request CRN enablement or visibility for your account.

1. Provision OpenSearch.
   Once CRN access is enabled for OpenSearch, you will see options in the watsonx.data console to:
   * Provision the OpenSearch service.
   * Choose from existing engines.
   For more information see, [Quick start OpenSearch configuration](/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-quick_start_opensearch) and [Adding an OpenSearch service](/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-add-opensearch).

1. Configure supporting services.
   After provisioning OpenSearch, you can enable supporting services or add other engines such as Presto or Spark.

**For existing users**

You can enable OpenSearch as an optional add-on component without impacting your current services.

Existing services will continue to be billed according to their standard terms. The OpenSearch feature is provided at no additional cost.
