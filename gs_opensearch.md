Getting started with OpenSearch service
{: #gs_opensearch_service}

**For new users**

1. Enable Cloud Resource Name (CRN) access.

   Contact your IBM Cloud account team to request CRN enablement or visibility for your account.

1. Provision OpenSearch.

   When the CRN access is enabled for OpenSearch, you see options in the watsonx.data console to:
   * Provision the OpenSearch service.
   * Choose from existing engines.

   For more information, see [Quick start OpenSearch configuration](/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-quick_start_opensearch) and [Adding an OpenSearch service](/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-add-opensearch).

1. Configure supporting services.

   After you provision the OpenSearch service, you can enable supporting services or add other engines such as Presto or Spark.

**For existing users**

You can enable OpenSearch as an optional add-on component without impacting your current services.

Existing services continue to be billed according to their standard terms. The OpenSearch feature is provided at no additional cost.
