# Resource groups
{: #rg_ov}

Resource groups help to manage query execution and resource allocation. Using resource groups, administrators can control the allocation and utilization of resources on a Presto cluster. Resource groups limit resource usage and enforce policy queues on queries.
{: shortdesc}

## Key features
{: #key_feat}

- Resource groups can set limits on resource usage such as CPU time, memory usage, or total number of queries (especially in multi-tenant environments to ensure that no single user or query monopolizes the system resources).
- Subgroups in resource groups allow hierarchical resource allocation. Each subgroup can have its own resource limits and policy queues.

For more information about resource groups, see [Resource Groups](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/admin/resource-groups.html).
