## Limitations for SQL statements
{: #connector_limitations}

* `DROP TABLE` statement is supported only when enabled in the catalog.
* `CREATE VIEW` can be used for a table only if that table is in the same catalog.
* `DROP TABLE` statement is supported only when enabled in the catalog.
* For data source-based catalogs the `CREATE SCHEMA`, `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP SCHEMA`, `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE`, `DROP VIEW`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `ALTER SCHEMA` statements are not available in the **Data Manager** UI.
* In the `CREATE VIEW` statement, column names must be enclosed in double quotes, and their case must match precisely as they are stored in the database, including uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case.

## Limitations for data types
{: #connector_limitations2}

* `NUMERIC` data type is not supported. You can use `DECIMAL` data type as an equivalent alternative to `NUMERIC` data type.
* When the fields of data type `REAL` have 6 digits or more in the decimal part with the digits being predominately zero, the values when queried are rounded off. It is observed that the rounding off occurs differently based on the precision of the values. For example, a decimal number 1.654 when rounded to 3-digits after the decimal point are the same. Another example is 10.890009 and 10.89000. It is noticed that 10.89000 is rounded to 10.89, whereas 10.89009 is not rounded off. This is an inherent issue because of the representational limitations of binary floating point formats. This might have a significant impact when querying involves sorting.

 **{{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}}** supports the unicode characters from the Presto (Java) engine with varchar and char data types.
