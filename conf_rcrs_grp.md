# Configuring Presto resource groups
{: #conf_rcrs_grp}

You can configure one or more Presto resource groups in {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}}.
{: shortdesc}

Presto (Java) engines in watsonx.data Lite plan instances do not support resource groups.
{: note}

To configure resource groups:

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} console.
1. From the navigation menu, go to **Configurations**.
1. Click the **Presto resource groups** tile.
   The **Presto resource groups** window opens.
1. Click **Create group**.
1. In the **Create resource group** window, enter the resource group details.

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | File name | Enter the JSON file name. If you upload a JSON file, the name of that file appears here. |
   | Description | Enter a resource group description. |
   | Resource group configuration | Browse and select a resource group JSON file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop a resource group file. |
   {: caption="Resource group details" caption-side="bottom"}

   The uploaded JSON file structure must match with the sample resource group file structure. To download the sample file, click **Download resource group template**. The maximum allowed size of a file is 2 MB and the only file format that is supported is `.json`.
   {: important}

   For more information about the resource group properties that you can define in the JSON file, see [Resource group properties]({{site.data.keyword.ref-resource_grp_pptys-link}}).

1. Click **Create** to create the resource group.

   To delete a resource group, go to the overflow menu of the resource group and click **Delete**. A confirmation box opens. Click **Delete** to confirm deletion. You cannot delete a resource group if it is assigned to an engine.
   {: note}

1. To edit the resource group file:
     1. Go to the overflow menu of the resource group and click **View details**.
     1. Click **Edit**. The resource group editor opens.
     1. Make the changes in the **Resource group details** and  **Resource manager configuration** sections, and click **Save**.

   If you edit an already assigned resource group file (file name or file content), the assigned engines restart with the changes.
   {: note}

1. To assign the resource group to engines, click the overflow menu of the resource group and select **Assign engines**.
1. Select one or more Presto engines from the **Available engines** section and click **Assign**.
   A confirmation box opens.

   If you click **Confirm**, the engines restart, and any ongoing queries of the data sources that are associated to the engines are terminated. You can have only one resource group assigned to an engine.
   {: note}

1. Click **Confirm** to complete the configuration.

## Unassigning resource group from engines
{: #unassign_rcrs_grp}

You can unassign a resource group from engines.
{: shortdesc}

1. From the **Currently assigned engines** section, select one or more engines that you want to unassign the resource group from.
1. Click **Unassign**. A confirmation box opens.

    If you click **Confirm**, the engines restart, and any ongoing queries of the data sources that are associated to the engines are terminated.
    {: note}

1. Click **Confirm** to unassign.
