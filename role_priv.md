# Managing roles and privileges
{: #role_priv}

A role is a set of privileges that is assigned to a user to allow the user to perform and manage certain tasks in {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}} provides a set of predefined roles: Administrator, User, Manager, Writer, and Reader.

Use the **Access control** page to manage users and roles in {{site.data.keyword.lakehouse_short}}. For more information, see [Managing user access]({{site.data.keyword.ref-manage_access-link}}).

The following tables describe the privileges that you can assign to roles and associated permissions:

Users can get relative storage role for all sub-folders and files in a storage or can be granted file action for particular folders or files. The following tables explain the storage-level and data-object-level S3 REST API permissions.

The following tables are applicable only if you are using IBM Spark that by default uses an S3 signature or if you are using S3 proxy.

| Writer |GET; HEAD; PUT; POST; PATCH; DELETE  |
| Reader |GET; HEAD  |
| Admin | GET; HEAD; PUT; POST; PATCH; DELETE |

| Write | GET; HEAD; PUT; PATCH; POST without `?delete` parameter |
| Delete | DELETE; POST with `?delete` parameter |
