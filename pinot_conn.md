# Apache Pinot
{: #pinot_database}

Apache Pinot is an open source-distributed database that is designed for real-time, user-facing analytics.
{: shortdesc}

 If you select **Apache Pinot** from the **Database type** drop-down list, configure the following details:

 | Field           | Description        |
 |------------------|--------------------|
 | Display name    | Enter the database name to be displayed on the screen. |
 | Hostname            | Enter the hostname.  |
 | Port             | Enter the port number. |
 | Controller authentication  | Use the toggle switch to enable Controller authentication. If enabled, enter the controller username and password. |
 | Broker authentication  | Use the toggle switch to enable Broker authentication. If enabled, enter the broker username and password. |
 | Port is SSL enabled   | Use the toggle switch to enable or disable SSL connection. If enabled, \n i. The Upload SSL certificate (.pem, .crt, .cert or .cer) link is enabled. \n ii. Click the Upload SSL certificate (.pem, .crt, .cert or .cer) link. \n iii. Browse the SSL certificate and upload.|
 | Test connection     | Click the Test connection link to test the data source connection. If the data source connection is successful, a success message appears.|
 | Catalog name | Enter the name of the catalog. This catalog is automatically associated with your database. |
 | Create | Click Create to create the database. |

## Limitations for SQL statements
{: #connector_limitations}

* When the Presto (Java) engine tries to contact the Apache Pinot server directly, the queries do not work in the following scenarios:
   * Nonlimit and Nonaggregate queries do not work with an SSL connection.

   * Limit queries that depend on an inner query that does not work with an SSL connection. For example,
    ```bash
      SELECT playerstint, teamid
      FROM pinot.default.baseballstats
      WHERE playerstint IN (
      SELECT playerstint
      FROM pinot.default.baseballstats
      LIMIT 2
      )
      LIMIT 5;
    ```
    {: codeblock}

* Queries to **Apache Pinot** fail if the broker's instance ID doesn't have a valid hostname or IP address.
* For database-based catalogs the `CREATE SCHEMA`, `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP SCHEMA`, `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE`, `DROP VIEW`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `ALTER SCHEMA` statements are not available in the **Data Manager** UI.

## Limitations for data types
{: #connector_limitations2}

* When the fields of data type `REAL` have 6 digits or more in the decimal part with the digits being predominately zero, the values when queried are rounded off. It is observed that the rounding off occurs differently based on the precision of the values. For example, a decimal number 1.654 when rounded to 3-digits after the decimal point are the same. Another example is 10.890009 and 10.89000. It is noticed that 10.89000 is rounded to 10.89, whereas 10.89009 is not rounded off. This is an inherent issue because of the representational limitations of binary floating point formats. This might have a significant impact when querying involves sorting.
